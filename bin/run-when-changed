# This is a homegrown "autotest".

# Requires inotify-tools: `sudo apt-get install inotify-tools` or http://inotify-tools.sourceforge.net/
# 
# Examples: 
#  
#   # Run whenever the model file or unit test is modified.
#   ./run_when_changed test/unit/model_test.rb test/unit/model_test.rb app/models/model.rb
# 
# Does not play well with rake
